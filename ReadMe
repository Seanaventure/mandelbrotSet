The mandelbrot set is a famous fractal. The fractal is colors based off if points in the complex plane are in the Mandelbrot set.

A number is in the Mandelbrot set if that complex number(c)is put in the function f(z) = z^2 + c and iterated, and if the limit
of the value stays less than 2

For example, f(z) = z^2 + c
             f(z^2+c) = (z^2+c)^2 + c
             f((z^2+c)^2) = ((z^2+c)^2)^2 + c
             and so on. If the value of that stays less than 2 it is in the Mandelbrot set
